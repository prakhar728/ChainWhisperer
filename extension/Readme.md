# 🧙‍♂️ ChainWhisperer — Onchain AI Copilot (Browser Extension)

> “Talk to your contracts before they talk back.”

---

## 🪄 One-Liner
A browser extension that acts as your personal AI copilot—analyzing smart contracts, flagging risks, and explaining interactions in real-time before you ever click "Confirm."

---

## 📖 Description
ChainWhisperer is a browser extension for Web3 users that brings AI-powered smart contract analysis directly into your browsing flow. Built for MantleExplorer and dApp users, it detects contracts on sites like Etherscan or while signing transactions, then explains what’s happening in plain English—highlighting potential risks and answering questions like “Is this contract safe?” or “What does this function do?”

Powered by Mantle Network and AI (via Thirdweb + Nubla), ChainWhisperer aims to make Web3 safer, clearer, and more accessible—especially for those who don’t read Solidity.

Future versions will evolve into a full wallet experience with natural language explanations for every onchain interaction.
